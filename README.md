# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-and-Visualization-Jupyter-Notebooks

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms and Visualization Jupyter Notebooks** repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrates various machine learning algorithms, along with data visualization techniques, implemented in Python.

## Overview

This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate data scientists understand and apply key machine learning algorithms. Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm or technique, providing a step-by-step guide that includes:
- **Explanation**: A brief introduction to the algorithm or technique.
- **Implementation**: Code implementation using Python and relevant libraries (such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `plotly`).
- **Visualization**: Data visualization to illustrate the behavior and performance of the algorithms.
- **Example**: Practical examples using real or simulated datasets.

## Contents

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Description**: A simple, non-parametric classification algorithm that predicts the class of a data point based on its closest neighbors.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes decision boundaries and the influence of the parameter K on the model's performance.

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
- **Description**: A versatile model used for both classification and regression tasks, represented as a tree-like structure.
- **Visualization**: Tree structure visualization and feature importance plots.

### 3. Logistic Regression
- **Description**: A statistical model used primarily for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of a class label.
- **Visualization**: Decision boundary visualization and ROC curve.

### 4. Multiple Linear Regression
- **Description**: Extends linear regression to multiple features, modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
- **Visualization**: Regression line, residual plots, and 3D plots for multi-dimensional data.

### 5. Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Description**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming feature independence.
- **Visualization**: Probability distributions and decision boundaries.

### 6. Plotly Visualizations
- **Description**: Demonstrates how to create interactive and aesthetically pleasing visualizations using Plotly, a powerful graphing library in Python.
- **Visualization**: Various plot types such as scatter plots, bar charts, and 3D plots.
